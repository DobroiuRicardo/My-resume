                Basketball is a sport where you can create your own playstyle and enjoy life.<br/>
                Shooting alone or playing in a team with friends, maybe a competition, is always relaxing and healthy for your mind and body too.<br/>
                While having fun, basketball helps your body to be more flexible and to have a better coordination in movements.<br/>
